                            presented by climate change and the increasing global demand for agricultural products
                            (1,2). Meeting these challenges demands renovation of breeding methods into the
                            next-generation technologies, collectively known as Breeding 4.0. Central to this frontier
                            is Genotype-to-Phenotype (G2P) prediction. For the prediction to be accurate and reliable,
                            developing and optimizing machine learning (ML) algorithms is one of the keys. A major
                            limitation nowadays to the employment of ML in breeding practices is the availability of
                            substantial Genotype-to-Phenotype pairs data, i.e., lack of well-curated and labelled
                            phenotypic data and their connection with genomic data, such as genetic variations.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">BreedingAIDB is the first manually curated G2P pairs database specifically
                            designed to support application of ML in G2P prediction and breeding practices. The Release
                            1.0 includes the G2P pairs data of rice, soybean, and maize. In addition to G2P pairs data,
                            BreedingAIDB offers three core functional modules: Feature Extraction, Phenotype Prediction,
                            and ML Project, each designed to enhance the utility of this database.</p>

                            gsctool features, which can be input directly into the G2P model. Unstructured data consists
                            of VCF (Variant Call Format) and GVCF (genomic VCF) data. All three types of crops G2P pairs
