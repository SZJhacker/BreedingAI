                    <p class="card-text">Rice, a paramount staple crop, is represented by a collection of
                        129,449 phenotypic records. This comprehensive assembly spans 12 distinct regions, spanning the
                        years from 2011 through 2018 and extending to 2020. Encompassing a spectrum of 41 distinct
                        traits, these phenotypic data illuminate facets ranging from growth patterns to yield
                        attributes, thereby affording a holistic grasp of rice's developmental and productive
                        expressions.</p>

                        crop, contributes 284,395 phenotypic entries. This dataset spans cultivation regions across five
                        distinct locales, covering a span of years encompassing 2013 through 2019. Across these years,
                        114 diverse phenotypic features are documented, forming a mosaic that captures the crop's
                        multifaceted attributes.</p>

                    <p>Our data collection efforts have focused on three major crop species, and we have transformed
                        the collected data into three distinct formats: two unstructured data types, namely GVCF and
                        VCF, and one structured data type called GSCtool features. These datasets, in conjunction with
                        the available phenotypic data, hold significant potential to drive advancements in the realm of
                        breeding machine learning.</p>
                    <p>By incorporating these comprehensive datasets, researchers can leverage them to develop
                        innovative tools and models in the field. The integration of genomic information (GVCF and VCF)
                        and structured features (GSCtool) with phenotypic data provides a robust foundation for
                        advancing breeding machine learning techniques and contributing to the progress of the field as

                    <p class="card-text">The engine of the feature extraction module is GSCtool, which is designed as a
                        flexible tool for extracting features from different types of SNPs variation detection result
                        files. Currently, three major crops are supported: rice, soybean and maize, based on IRGSP 1.0,
                        Williams 82 and B73 reference genomes, respectively. gsctool is easy to operate, and users can
                        upload the corresponding variant detection result files for feature extraction. For other
                        reference genomes, users can use gsctool with the corresponding gff3 files for customised
                        feature extraction. This module enables users to extract key information from genomic variation
                        data, laying a solid foundation for subsequent machine learning model construction.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The machine learning model building module combines the power of optuna and
                        lightgbm to provide users with a highly customisable model optimisation framework. Within a
                        predefined hyperparameter space, users can adjust the hyperparameters according to their
                        specific needs and upload data files obtained from previous feature extraction for model
                        construction. optuna will search the hyperparameter space to find the best model configuration.
                        lightgbm, a fast and efficient gradient boosting framework, is able to efficiently process
                        large-scale data and generate accurate predictive models. The labels in the data files uploaded
                        by the user will be considered as prediction targets, thus enabling the model construction and
                        prediction processes to be closely linked.</p>
